##How Private Are Android Phones Really
> Description
In my own words, I plan to analyse the security and privacy of certain apps running on an Android Phone. To do this I will be using a rooted google pixel 4, running Frida and will conduct a man-in-the-middle attack to allude the encryption and gain access and capture the traffic. 
Some apps ive taken a quick overview at already, Google Play Store, Weather Apps, Browers ~(have an issue with google chrome currently)~. Also planning on delving into the Dublin bus + Leap Top Up applications.
